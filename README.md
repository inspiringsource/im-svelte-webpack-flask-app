# Svelte.js + Python Flask Inventory Management Application

Example of using Flask to serve a Svelte app and use it as a backend server.

Activate the virtual environment. 
```bash
# Windows
env/Scripts/activate

# Linux, WSL or macOS
source env/bin/activate
```

Run the following for development:

- `python3 server.py` to start the Flask server.
- `cd frontend; npm run dev` to start the Svelte frontend.

Open `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the app.
